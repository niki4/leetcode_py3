"""
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with logarithmic complexity?

    Bruteforce solution.
    Algorithm idea: Peak's next element is lower (descent). Also there's special case when there only ascent, so the
    peak will be the last element in this case.
